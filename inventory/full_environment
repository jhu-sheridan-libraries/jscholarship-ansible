# NOTE: USE WITH CAUTION
# this is intended to manage cross-environment operations
# (e.g. data refresh from prod to stage &/or dev)
# running a playbook without proper limiting will affect dev, stage, and prod
# ...there are lots of ways this could be problematic.
# for most operations, use of the environment-specific inventory files is recommended
